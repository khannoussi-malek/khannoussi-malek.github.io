              Chakra UI is an open-source React library that provides a simple
              and flexible foundation for building accessibility-first user
              interfaces. It was developed to help developers build accessible
              and modern applications with ease, and is designed to be
              lightweight, customizable, and easy to use.

              One of the main features of Chakra UI is its comprehensive set of
              accessible and customizable components. These components include
              basic UI elements such as buttons, forms, and layout containers,
              as well as more advanced components such as modals, tabs, and
              carousels. Each component is designed to be fully accessible and
              follows best practices for accessibility, including support for
              screen readers and keyboard navigation.

              In addition to its components, Chakra UI also provides a set of
              utility functions and styles that can be used to customize the
              look and feel of an application. These utilities include things
              like color palettes, typography styles, and spacing functions,
              which can be used to create a consistent design across an
              application.

              To use Chakra UI, you will need to have a basic understanding of
              React and the React ecosystem. You can install Chakra UI using the
              npm package manager, and then import the components and styles
              into your React application.
